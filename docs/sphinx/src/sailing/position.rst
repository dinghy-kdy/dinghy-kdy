Position on the boat
====================

* ``no waves`` If there are no waves, position your body as far up as possible, in whichever angle to the wind.
* ``waves`` If there are waves, position your body backwards as to lift the bow, preventing it from diving into the sea and losing speed.
* ``hiking`` never let your bottom touch the water, anything that touches the water produces ``drag``
