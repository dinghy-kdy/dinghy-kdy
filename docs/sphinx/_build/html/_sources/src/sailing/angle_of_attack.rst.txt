Angle of attack
---------------

* ``upwind``, ``> 6m/s``
   * Sail the boat at about ``30 degrees``, making sure both ``tail tellers`` are horizontal. If the ``windward tail teller`` is not horizontal, then the sail ``windward`` thrust is not optimal. If the ``leeward tail teller`` is not horizontal, then the sail ``leeward`` thrust is not optimal.
   * The sail MUST be fully trimmed in (the ``boom vang`` will help lowering the ``boom``)
